<p><i>To R. D. L.</i>:</p>
</div>
     <p>“There are some ghosts,” said poor Jack,
“that will not easily bear raising....”</p>
     <p>Thus am I confounded by words of my own
choosing, for in truth I have raised one; and
not for me, as for Dame Sylvia, does Chivalry
blow upon a silver horn to drown the squeakings
of that folly. Which is merely another
way of saying that those younglings we two
know and love, and who fretted me into the
writing of a play for their theatricals, have rejected
the outcome after a tentative rehearsal,
with certain remarks for my pondering.</p>
     <p>Well might that fat whoresome man have
been left to the undignified fate his creator had
appointed for him!—or at least in the staider
trappings wherewith I did gird his behemothian
bulk in my story, <i>The Love Letters
of Falstaff</i>. Decked for the stage and with
bella donna in its eyes, my sketch, they tell me,
is a ghastly remains to which the footlights
would add but the effect of funeral candles. In
fine, that which lacks both plot and action, and
offers, in lieu of lusty characters, four gray
ghosts, is not a play but an edifying exposé of
the pitfalls and snares into which a romancist
might be expected to stumble when he dons the
habit of a playwright. These and many other
plaints which I shall strive to live down in the
years before me, conveyed a discomforting
unanimity of opinion on the part of my hopeful
players.</p>

	<p>With such humility as becomes one of our
soberer estate in the presence of these, our
juniors and betters, I pointed out that it was
not my fault, assuredly, that Falstaff was no
longer the merry taker of purses whose roaring
oaths had filled all Gadshill. Nor that Will
had never displayed any very hearty admiration
for humanity nor found many more commendable
traits in general exercise among its
individuals than did the authors of the Bible:
a spirit which, however distasteful to my palate,
I was obliged in this instance to emulate!
Yet I dared think (and my defense grew
noticeably weaker under their incredulous
stare) that old, gross and decayed as he had
grown, the demiurge still clings to the old
reprobate; yea, and the aura of divinity to
Helen, whose beauty is drifting dust, so that
Falstaff sees before him not Sylvia Vernon but
Sylvia Darke.</p>
             <p>Poor Falstaff. “Were’t not for laughing I
should pity him!”</p>
             <p>But they had since ceased to listen. Vanished
were they like the merry company whose mere
names, thought Falstaff, were like a breath of
country air. My script lay before me, eloquent
in naught but their disillusion. Alone, I thought
the fire winked knowingly at me, much like the
one I had fanned from the embers of the past,
as if it said: How old must a man become ’ere
he shall be wise enough to content these sure
young critics, so awfully and so inevitably
right?</p>
    <p>I should have dropped the record of my folly
into the flames and so played out the last scene
in my puppet’s stead, had I not remembered in
time my promise to you. Well!—you had expected
to receive it worn from the caresses of
eager thumbs, scented perhaps with the bouquet
of reverent applause. It comes to you fresh
and unmarred by any defacing ardor; only its
theme is sere, only its author’s vanity thumb-marked!</p>
        <p>And remember: ’tis not a play you give to
the world but rather a spirit croaking to itself
in a house where nobody has lived for a long
time.</p>
